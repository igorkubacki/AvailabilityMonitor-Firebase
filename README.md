## 📄 General info
The app was created to monitor product stock and prices and change it on the website I am currently managing. It imports products from PrestaShop, then adds info about stock and prices based on the supplier XML file and notifies about any changes.

## ✨ Features

* Importing products from your PrestaShop online store - no need to add them manually.
* Easily browse your products - sort and filter them as you need.
* Meaningful data charts - see the price and quantity for each product in past months.
* Notifications page - a quick insight into latest changes.


## ✔️ How it works

* Import your products from PrestaShop by just entering your shop URL and API key in the configuration tab.
* Enter the URL of the supplier XML file with your products (products will be matched by the product SKU).
* Now you can update supplier info when you want and see all the changes.
